/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SnipQueue.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for customer data and
 * restricts barber and service data management to administrators. Public read
 * access is granted for services.  All other data requires authentication and
 * appropriate authorization.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /customers/{customerId}: Stores customer profiles. CustomerId must match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /barbers/{barberId}: Stores barber profiles. Only admins can manage.
 * - /services/{serviceId}: Stores service information. Publicly readable, admin-only management.
 * - /customers/{customerId}/appointments/{appointmentId}: Stores appointments. CustomerId must match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /barbers/{barberId}/schedules/{scheduleId}: Stores barber schedules. Admin-only management.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Customer data is strictly owned by the authenticated user.
 * - Barber and Service management is restricted to admins (currently not implemented).
 * - Services are publicly readable.
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect privacy.
